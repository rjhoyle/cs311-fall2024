## Course Description

This course examines the logical design of databases using the entity-relationship,
relational, and object-oriented models; and database application programming using SQL,
JDBC, and PHP. Other topics include security and integrity, concurrency control and
distributed database systems.

## Prerequisites

CSCI 241 or consent of the instructor.  You should be comfortable with low-level
programming with procedural languages, such as C and Java.  We will be discussing
hardware and memory-related concepts, so CSCI 210 will be helpful, but is not a
requirement.

## Course Goals

* Understand the theoretical background that influences database design.
* Be familiar with the different layers that go in a web-app that has a database layer, and be able to create a simple one using modern
* Explore current trends in database systems, as well as access models.
